The Automatic Customer: Creating a subscription business in any industry
=========================================================================

Why have Subscription Models picked up?
=======================================

1.  **Access Generation**: A growing cohort of mobile, technically savvy young people who value access over assets. They are behind the explosion of the new "sharing economy" - Airbnb, Uber, Facebook
2.  Light-Switch Reliability: The internet is becoming as pervasive and reliable as the dependable light-switch. You switch on and expect the bulb to light. The more reliable Internet has become, the more we are willing to entrust the Internet.
3.  Delicious Data: Subscription businesses provide a ton of data and insights about the subscribers.
4.  The Longtail: The internet has lowered the cost of distribution and our appetites have increased as a result. One-size fits all is no longer acceptable. Customers want to express their individuality and subscriptions allow them to do that.

**Why you need automatic customers:**
=====================================

1.  Drive up the value of your company
2.  Increase the lifetime value of your customers
3.  Smooth out demand
4.  Cut the cost of customer market research
5.  Automate the collection of receivables
6.  Lock in your most promiscuous customers (those who are always looking for a deal and who will switch for a small price advantage)
7.  Trigger customers to buy a broader selection of your products and services
8.  Inoculate your business from the worst of a recession

The Membership Website Model
============================

-   The membership website subscription model involves publishing your know-how behind a paywall that requires members to buy access to your secrets.
-   [RestaurantOwner.com](http://restaurantowner.com/), for example, helps aspiring chefs create profitable restaurants. [ContractorSelling.com](http://contractorselling.com/) helps plumbers and electricians build their companies.
-   While that customer can be lucrative on his own, most membership website operators use the subscription relationship as a platform to cross-sell additional things.
-   When to consider:

1.  A tightly defined niche market, like ambitious dance studio owners or Italy junkies or woodworking enthusiasts.
2.  Access to a steady flow of unique knowledge, or expertise insider information that is constantly changing and that subscribers need to stay in the know.
3.  Another product or service you can sell to your subscribers.

The All-You-Can-Eat Library Model
=================================

-   The all-you-can-eat library subscription model offers unlimited access to a warehouse of value. Like any library, you'll never consume all of the information available, but the breadth of content that is offered promises to always have something you like. Ex - Netflix, Amazon Prime
-   When to consider:

1.  A library of "evergreen" content---or the wherewithal to acquire one. Netflix owns the rights to more than 100,000 movies and television shows for its streaming subscription. Even the most couch-addicted teenager could not consume the entire library, especially since new movies and original content are added regularly, which means that there is always a reason to keep up your subscription.
2.  A legion of existing fans (blog subscribers, Twitter followers, LinkedIn connections, etc.) who already consume your free content.

-   What Insiders say:

1.  Successful all-you-can-eat library model operators sprinkle just enough new content into the offering to keep subscribers loyal while relying on a large library of "evergreen" content as the foundation of membership.
2.  To prevent subscribers from cherry-picking the best parts of your library, it may be necessary to give customers an ultimatum: subscribe to the entire library or you can't access any of it.
3.  The acquisition of your library is a chicken-or-egg conundrum. Unless you have a truckload of money, look for creative ways to partner (e.g., licensing, revenue-sharing agreements) with content owners to build a library that's large enough to impress subscribers.

The Private Club Model
======================

-   The private club model offers subscribers ongoing access to something rare. - TIGER21, Clubhouse
-   A large part of the value of the private club model is not only accessing that which is rare but also the chance to meet with a network of other people who---like you---made the cut.
-   Exclusive things are bought on emotion and justified with logic.
-   The private club model sells social status---think of it as social climbing on subscription.

The Front-of-the-Line Model
===========================

-   The front-of-the-line subscription model involves selling priority access to a group of your customers. Ex- Salesforce
-   With the front-of-the-line subscription model you're being transparent about who gets served first, which in some ways is fairer than deprioritizing some customers without telling them why.
-   Could you charge your customers a small monthly fee for peace of mind, for knowing that when they have an issue they will be taken care of first?
-   When to consider:

1.  A relatively complex product or service. -Counselling
2.  Customers who are not overly price sensitive.
3.  Customers for whom waiting in line can have catastrophic consequences.

The Consumables Model
=====================

-   It involves offering a subscription to a product that the customer needs to replenish on a regular basis. The value proposition is simple: life is too short to worry about mundane tasks like remembering to pick up diapers or razor blades. Subscribe and you'll never run out. - Ex. - Dollar Shave Club, Blacksocks, [Diapers.com](http://Diapers.com), Milkbasket
-   How to differentiate their offerings from what big online retailers like Amazon and Walmart can offer or their stance- let us buy you or we'll put you out of business?
-   Your Best Defence : Branding
    -   Building a unique brand requires that your positioning meet two criteria: it needs to be important to customers and make you unique.
-   It's not like buying a car, where you get to slide into a beautiful leather seat and inhale the new-car smell. You're buying a commodity, and if you're not going to offer a branded experience, then the fastest, least painful option always wins.
-   A big part of building a brand is controlling the product itself.
-   For a consumables subscription model to work in the long term, you need something other than price and selection to compete against the big players.
-   When to consider:

1.  Something to sell consumers that naturally runs out.
2.  Something to offer that is annoying to replenish.

The Surprise Box Model
======================

-   This model involves shipping a curated package of goodies to your subscribers each month. As the name suggests, part of the fun for the customer is discovering a new set of products each month. Such boxes are typically built around a theme users feel passionate about. - Barkbox, Conscious Box
-   A big part of the value these subscription companies provide is curation,which has become increasingly important as Google has made choice infinite.

The Simplifier Model
====================

-   With the simplifier model, you offer to take one or more recurring tasks off your customers' to-do lists. Ex - Hassle-Free-Home-Services
-   **Set It and Forget it :** The simplifier model promises two things: not only will you take to-do items off your customer's list, you will also be the one reminding the customer that the task needs doing. One part of why we're feeling overwhelmed is the length of our to-do lists; the other part is trying to remember all of our tasks and commitments. Remembering takes up space on our mental hard drive, which leads to anxiety and a sense of being overwhelmed.
-   You get the recurring revenue and steady work, and your customer gets the benefit of knowing it's one less thing to remember to do.

The Network Model
=================

-   One of the defining characteristics of the network model is that, unlike the private club model, the utility of the subscription increases as more people subscribe. Ex- Whatsapp.
-   You need subscribers to build the network, but you need a network to attract subscribers. Focus your limited resources on a small, tightly defined group of early-adopting customers. Build density before moving to your next market.
-   The good news is that once you build the network, the cost to enter the market, coupled with a network of happy users who benefit from promoting you , becomes a protective shield against would-be competitors. The word of mouth from your passionate user base helps guide and fuel your growth by providing free market research about the new products, features, and benefits they want you to offer next.
-   The bad news is that if subscribers flip from happy to dissatisfied, the same powerful force that helps you grow a network model subscription business can start to work against you.

The Peace-of-Mind Model
=======================

-   This works on the principle of offering insurance against something your customers hope they'll never need. You are there to help your customers when they need your service, but otherwise, you stay out of their way. You make money from charging more in subscription revenue than it costs you to deliver the service when called upon.
-   One of the challenges of the peace-of-mind model is guessing how frequently your customers will need your service. Underestimate and you will end up spending more than you collect in premiums. Overestimate significantly and you will be susceptible to competitors offering to insure your customers at a lower rate or having your customers opt to "selfinsure," which means they opt to bypass insurance altogether.
-   Provided you charge more in premiums than you expect to pay out in services provided, you will earn an underwriting profit. While this underwriting profit is important, the real money is made from something called float.
-   Float is the money you make investing the cash people pay in insurance premiums before they make a claim.
-   The peace-of-mind model is different than the simplifier model, in which you set up a service contract to preemptively service your customers. In the peace-of-mind model, you're offering an insurance to help only if your customer needs it.

How to build a Subscription Model
=================================

-   **Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)/Annual Recurring Revenue -** This is the recurring revenue listed on your company's P&L every month. When a customer subscribes to a membership website for $99 per year, the company gets to recognize that revenue on its P&L at the MRR rate of $8.25 ($99 divided by 12).
-   **Lifetime value (LTV) of a subscriber.** LTV is calculated by multiplying your MRR by the number of months your customer stays with you, less the cost of serving them during the life of the subscription.
-   **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).** -This is the amount of money you spend on sales and marketing to win a new subscriber.
-   **The Viability Threshold -** As per Skok at Matrix Venture partners, **I**n order to be a viable subscription business over the long term, a company needs to have an **LTV:CAC ratio of at least 3:1.**
-   **Churn Rate**: The rate at which customers quit subscribing. Let's say you have 1,000 subscribers who pay you $500 per month. Further, let's imagine a month when 18 of your customers leave. Your MRR is $500,000 ($500 × 1,000), and your lost MRR is 18 × $500 = $9,000, so your churn rate for the month is 1.8% ($9,000 divided by $500,000).
-   Churn viewed in isolation is not as meaningful as looking at churn in relation to how much it costs you to win new customers.
-   **LTV = MRR * Margin ( Profit ) divided by Monthly Churn { ARR * Gross Margin div by Annual Churn)**
-   **CAC Payback Period : H**ow many months it takes you to make back the cost of acquiring a customer.

-   As the CAC increases , so does the CAC payback and assuming you control the churn, LTV reduces and vice versa.

-   How to accumulate funds at start:

    1.  Rob Peter to pay Paul : Invest the profits of your traditional business to build a subscription business. Ex- Basecamp

        -   Pros - Complete control, zero equity dilution
        -   Cons - Longer time to scale, not prudent in winner-takes-all segment
    2.  Outside Money

    3.  Charge upfront

-   In order to grow your subscription business while minimizing the amount of cash you need from other sources, shoot for a CUF(Charge Up Front) :CAC ratio north of 1:1.

-   CUF could be a set-up cost or exclusive membership fees or an annual pre-paid subscription something that does not cash-strap you from growing bigger.

-   Your LTV:CAC determines whether or not an investor will want to invest in your business, while your CUF:CAC ratio will determine how much of an investor's money you'll need, and how much of your equity you will have to give up in the process.

The Psychology of Selling a Subscription
========================================

-   **Subscription Fatigue:** Today, we're buying a lot more on subscription, so those small monthly charges are adding up to a big nut each month. In addition, many of us have experienced the frustration of trying to turn off a sticky subscription or figuring out the origin of a credit card charge from an obscure subscription we bought years earlier. Increasingly, our bar for opting into a subscription relationship is getting higher.
-   **Subscription Selling Idea # 1: Think 10 × vs. 10%**
    -   A consumer with an acute case of subscription fatigue is unlikely to subscribe just to save 10%, but she might be convinced to subscribe if you could make a case that she will enjoy 10 times the value of the alternative or 10 times the return on investment
-   **Subscription Selling Idea # 2: Appeal to Their Rational Side**
    -   Subscriptions have become mainstream now. Gone are the days when people bought subscriptions to razor blades as a novelty
-   **Subscription Selling Idea # 3: Give Customers an Ultimatum**
    -   Shows heightened commitment and users consider your option seriously
-   **Subscription Selling Idea # 4: Give Them a "Freemium" Option**
    -   One way to overcome their anxiety about committing is to offer a free taste of what they will get from a full-blown subscription.
    -   You'll want to leave plenty of value off the table to instill a sense of intrigue about what the customer will get from subscribing. A good taster gives you just enough to assess the product but leaves plenty of temptations behind the curtain.
-   **Subscription Selling Idea # 5: Offer a Trial**
    -   If you have a product or service that is very hard to describe and that customers have to use before they will understand the benefits of subscribing, you may want to consider offering a trial.
    -   Examples - Osler, Freshbook
    -   Freshbook, at one time, did not have any pricing plan info on its pricing plan page but only asked for email and company name to start a 30 day free trial, which leaves one to draw the conclusion that getting people signed up for a free trial is the most important first step in converting a user into a paid customer.
    -   **Throughout the free trial process, the focus should not be on getting the user to buy the product but to use the product - an important distinction.**
-   **Subscription Selling Idea # 6: Offer Your Subscription as a Gift**
-   The "always on" feature of a Netflix or an Amazon Prime is fantastic for consumers but can be frustrating when you're trying to sell a subscription. If your service doesn't change from one day to the next, why should a prospect buy today? If the exact same offering is going to be available tomorrow, it is human nature to wait until you absolutely need to act unless there is something you will miss out on by procrastinating.
-   **Subscription Selling Idea # 7: Set Fire to the Platform**
    -   The very best salespeople set fire to the platform only when the customer has made the decision to subscribe and it is only a question of when. All it takes is a quiet, authentic conversation with your prospect who is already 95% of the way there. It's best not to publicize your burning platform offer; you want to avoid the perception that you are a discounter to people who are much earlier in the buying cycle.
-   **The Treadmill to no where**
    -   New MRR : Churn Rate X MRR
    -   You are trapped in a cycle of MRR reaching to a point where new MRR cannot compensate for the churned MRR and it eventually then drops to a point where you can now compensate the lost revenue by new users till you hit the zenith again and the cycle keeps repeating.

Lowering Churn
==============

-   As you build your subscription business, your job is to be the rogue jet.
-   Churn is directly related to use: the more your subscribers use your service, the less likely they are to churn. The stickiest subscription businesses make it their mission to insert themselves into the daily lives of their customers.
-   Keeping a watch over the 90-day onboarding clock. The first few months are critical when it comes to convincing a customer of the value of the subscription.
-   Therefore, your biggest competitor for your subscription business is not the rival service; it is your customer's inertia in not using your service. For a subscription to stick, customers need to change their behavior and actually use the service. You have a short window to break your customers' old habits and insert yourself in their daily lives. That window is the first few weeks after they have purchased, before the excitement about what your subscription offers wears off.
-   The most challenging part of testing your subscription's impact is that you cannot immediately see the effect of your changes on your churn. You need to track a group of customers---most subscription companies call these "cohorts"---over time to see what effects your onboarding changes have on your customers' behavior.
-   Part of getting people to adopt your subscription product or service in the first 90 days is **to give them a quick win that provides the motivation for them to learn more.**
-   Charging up front for your subscription means you're locking in a year's worth of renewals (unless you provide refunds) and getting your customer's cash up front. More important, it prompts a customer to make a bigger commitment to learning and adopting your subscription, making them much more likely to renew. When you cough up $5,000 for a subscription, you're a lot more committed to learning how to use it in the first 90 days than if you were paying $399 a month.
-   New lovers have a thirst to understand you intimately. An older subscriber will find your constant communication annoying after a while, whereas a new subscriber welcomes your contacts and takes the time to consume them.
-   The best subscription companies always sprinkle in a little something surprising for their subscribers. BarkBox calls these spontaneous gifts "happiness bombs."
-   As you build your subscription business, you will accumulate a truckload of data about your subscribers. Using that information to surprise them from time to time can go a long way to keeping the relationship alive and well.
-   Focus on "Net Churn" if you could offset some churn by upgrading your subscribers to a higher MRR. **Net Churn = Gross Churn - Upgrade Revenue**
