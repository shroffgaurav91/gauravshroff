# What is good design?

These are basis my takeaways from Dieter Rams' 10 Principles of Good Design

- Your product should talk to the user. There should be no gap between what users perceive this product would do versus what it actually does.
- Your users must find the product easy enough to use and interact with. Even interacting with the product may often be a source of delight for well designed products.
- Design as little as possible and avoid cluttering. Keep it simple.
- Be upfront and honest with the users. Well designed products avoid giving false promises or caveats.
